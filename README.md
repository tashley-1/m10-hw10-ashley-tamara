(**NOTE:** View a rendered version of this file in VS Code with `ctrl-shift-v` or `cmd-shift-v`)

&nbsp;
## Background

This assignment is meant to familiarize you with BEM (Block Element Modifier), a system for organizing CSS.

&nbsp;
## Setup

Create a git repository titled `m10-hw10-lastname-firstname` and clone the repo to your computer. Copy the **contents** of the `unsolved` folder into your repository. Ensure the `index.html` file is in the **root** of your repository so that it deploys to GitHub pages properly.

&nbsp;
## Instructions

Use the provided code in the `unsolved` folder and modify the `index.html` and `style.css` files to follow BEM conventions. To earn full-credit for this assignment you must:

1. Convert all existing CSS selectors to BEM classes.
    * You will have to add your new BEM class to the HTML elements as well as replace the current selector in the stylesheet with the BEM class name.
1. Follow BEM best practices:
    * Avoid tag and ID selectors.
    * [Use properly named BEM class names](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/#naming)
    * [Avoid nested selectors](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/#nested-selectors).
    * [Avoid combined selectors](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/#combined-selectors).
1. Preserve the existing styling and behavior of the site through your changes.


&nbsp;
## Deployment

Your code must be deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages you must:

1. Ensure your repository has an `index.html` file in the root directory.
1. Navigate to the `settings` section of the repository.
1. Click on `pages` in the left navigation menu.
1. Under `source` click the dropdown and select your `master` or `main` branch.
1. Click `save`.

Your site should be deployed to `<your github username>.github.io/<your repository name>` in 5-10 minutes.

## Submission

Please submit both a link to your repository and a link to the live site. Also please include any comments on stumbling blocks or difficulties encountered while completing the assignment.
